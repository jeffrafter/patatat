You will need to copy patatat.conf.example to patatat.conf and then put in 
actual twitter account details. 

You will also need to install some gems - according to what is "require"d at the 
top of the scripts.
 
To setup fsdb:

wget http://redshift.sourceforge.net/fsdb/fsdb-0.5.tgz
tar -xvzf fsdb-0.5.tgz
cd fsdb-0.5
ruby install.rb config
ruby install.rb setup
sudo ruby install.rb install
cd ..
rm -rf fsdb-0.5*

To run the specs you will need rspec. Then within the root patatat folder you
can run "spec spec" or "autotest"
